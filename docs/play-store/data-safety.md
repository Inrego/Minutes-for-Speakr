# Google Play — Data Safety Form

The reasoning behind the Play Console **Data safety** answers
(App content → Data safety). The answers themselves, in paste-ready form, are in
[`SUBMISSION-RUNBOOK.md`](SUBMISSION-RUNBOOK.md) §4 — **that file is what you
fill the Console from; this one is why.** The two are reconciled as of
2026-09-22; if they ever disagree, the runbook is the submission and this file
is the bug.

Review every answer before submitting — you are legally responsible for its
accuracy.

> **Settled 2026-09-22 — "Is all of the user data encrypted in transit?" is

These answers reflect what the app's code actually does, verified against the
repository:

- No analytics, advertising, crash-reporting, or third-party tracking SDKs are
  present in `pubspec.yaml` (no Firebase / Analytics / Crashlytics / Sentry /
  ads / Facebook / Amplitude / Mixpanel / Segment, etc.).
- The app sends user data **only** to the Speakr server the user configures.
  There is no developer-operated backend.
- The server URL and API token are stored in OS secure storage
  (`flutter_secure_storage`, Android Keystore-backed).
- The app can capture **other apps' audio** (Android `MediaProjection` +
  `AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration`, `SpeakrAudioRecorder.kt`) and it
  **deletes source files from the user's watched folders** after upload, plus
  files shorter than a user-set minimum duration (`auto_upload_worker.dart`).
  Both are disclosed in `privacy-policy.md` (sections "Recording other apps'
  audio" and "Auto-upload, folder access, and deletion of your files") and
  the answers below reflect them.
- On Android the watched folders are reached through a **Storage Access
  Framework tree grant** per folder the user picked — not All files access.
  `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` **was removed** in the SAF migration (#4, merged
  2026-09-22) and is absent from the manifest. The permission audit (#7, same
  day) then removed `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` and `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` as well, so
  the app now declares **no storage permission of any kind** on Android. No
  answer in this form depended on any of them: the scope of what auto-upload
  reads and deletes — the user-chosen folders — is unchanged; only the
  permission mechanism narrowed.
- The app has **no single-file picker on Android** (`file_picker` is used only
  for `getDirectoryPath()`). Audio reaches the server from exactly two places:
  the in-app live recorder, and auto-upload from folders the user granted. Do
  not describe a "pick a file to upload" flow in any Android-facing text.

## Section A — Data collection & sharing (top-level answers)

| Question | Draft answer | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? | **Yes** | Audio + metadata are transmitted to the user's server; that counts as "collected". |
| Is all of the user data encrypted in transit? | **No** — settled 2026-09-22 | `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` (`AndroidManifest.xml:38`) is **deliberate**, so users can reach self-hosted `http://` servers on their own LAN. HTTPS does work, and is what happens whenever the user's server has TLS — but Google's checkbox is all-or-nothing, and because plain HTTP is a supported and intended path, **Yes** would be untrue. Answer **No** and explain the self-hosted model in the free text (Section E) and the review notes. The cost is a "Data isn't encrypted in transit" line on the store listing, which is honest for a LAN-first self-hosted client. The only thing that could flip this to Yes is enforcing HTTPS in a future build — which would cut off exactly the LAN users the setting exists for. |
| Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted? | **Yes (qualified)** | The developer holds no data; deletion happens on the user's own server/device. Explain in the policy. |

---

## Section B — Data types collected

Mark each as **Collected** (transmitted off device) and **not Shared** (Google
defines "shared" as transfer to a *third party*; the user's own self-hosted
server is the user's designated destination, not a third party — but see the
caveat note at the bottom).

### Audio files / voice or sound recordings

- **Collected:** Yes
- **Shared:** No (sent only to the user's configured server)
- **Processed ephemerally:** No (the recording is uploaded and stored on the
  user's server for transcription)
- **Required or optional:** Required for the core recording/upload feature
- **Purpose:** App functionality (recording, upload, transcription)
- **User data deletion:** handled on the user's server
- **What the audio can contain (state this in the free text):**
  - the user's microphone;
  - **other apps' playback audio** captured via `MediaProjection` when the
    user turns on the system-audio source for a session — that can include
    other participants of a call or video meeting, subject to Android only
    exposing `USAGE_MEDIA` / `USAGE_GAME` / `USAGE_UNKNOWN` streams and to
    apps opting out;
  - **audio files written by other apps** (call recorders, voice recorders)
    that auto-upload picks up from user-chosen folders. Under Play's taxonomy
    these fall under Audio → "Voice or sound recordings" and/or "Other audio
    files"; tick both so the auto-upload path is covered.
- **Deletion from the device:** after a successful upload the app deletes the
  source file from the watched folder, and deletes files shorter than a
  user-set minimum duration without uploading them. This is not a form field,
  but it is in the policy, so the free text should say it too (see Section E).
  On Android the delete happens through the user's SAF folder grant; there is
  no All-files-access declaration to keep it consistent with.

### "Other" user-generated content — meeting metadata

Tags, notes, speaker names, meeting date, language/speaker-count settings.
For auto-uploaded files, also the **file name** and **last-modified time**
(sent as the meeting date).

- **Collected:** Yes
- **Shared:** No
- **Required/optional:** Optional (metadata fields are optional)
- **Purpose:** App functionality

### App activity / other — transcripts & summaries

These are produced **by the server** and displayed in the app; they are
downloaded from the user's server, not collected by the developer. If the form
asks only about data the app *sends/collects from the user*, transcripts are
server-generated content fetched back — generally **not** a "collected" type
the developer must declare. **CONFIRM** by reading Play's current definitions;
when in doubt, declare under "App info and performance → Other app data" as
user-content fetched from the user's own server.

### Credentials — API token & server URL

- **Collected by the developer/transmitted to third parties:** **No**
- These are stored **locally** in OS secure storage and sent only to the user's
  own server as an auth header. They are not transmitted to the developer or any
  third party.
- Google's Data Safety form is about data leaving the device to the developer or
  third parties; locally stored credentials that only authenticate to the user's
  own server are **not** "collected" in Play's sense. Do **not** list the token
  as collected-by-developer. (If the form's "Personal info → User IDs / other"
  prompts, note in free text that auth tokens are stored locally and encrypted.)

---

## Section C — Data NOT collected (explicitly answer No)

Based on the code, the app does **NOT** collect or transmit any of:

- Location (precise or approximate)
- Contacts
- Personal info: name, email address, user IDs (beyond the local API token),
  address, phone number, race/ethnicity, political/religious beliefs, sexual
  orientation
- Financial info (no payment info, no purchase history)
- Health & fitness data
- Photos / videos
- Calendar / SMS / call logs
- Web browsing history
- Installed apps inventory — see the Windows note below
- **Device or other identifiers** (advertising ID, etc.) — no ad/analytics SDKs
- **Crash logs / diagnostics / analytics** — no crash-reporting or analytics SDK
  is integrated

> Note on media projection: the Android app captures **audio only** through
> `AudioPlaybackCaptureConfiguration`. It never creates a `VirtualDisplay` or
> reads screen content, so "Photos and videos" stays **No** even though the
> user sees Android's *screen-capture* consent dialog.

> Note on the Windows microphone-usage monitor (`mic_monitor.dart`): the
> **Windows** build polls the registry to learn which applications are using
> the microphone and keeps a local list of up to 30 recently seen application
> names. That is not in the Android app at all (`createMicMonitor` returns a
> no-op off Windows), it is read locally, and it is never transmitted, so it is
> **not** "collected" in Play's sense and does not change the "Installed apps"
> answer. It is disclosed in the policy so the hosted policy and this form
> stay consistent.

> Note on `READ_PHONE_STATE`: the app reads call **state** (ringing/idle/offhook)
> to trigger an upload scan when a call ends. It does **not** read the phone
> number, call log, or any identifier, and does not transmit phone state
> anywhere. So this does not add a "collected" data type — but be ready to
> explain it in the sensitive-permission declaration (see `checklist.md`).

## Section D — Security practices (the "Security practices" sub-section)

| Question | Draft answer | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Is data encrypted in transit? | **No** | The settled answer (Section A). Cleartext HTTP is a supported path for self-hosted LAN servers, so the all-or-nothing box cannot honestly be ticked. Matches `SUBMISSION-RUNBOOK.md` §4.1 and §4.5. |
| Can users request data deletion? | **Yes** | On their own server/device; no developer-held data. |
| Committed to Play Families Policy? | **No / N/A** | Not a children's app. |
| Independent security review? | **No** | None performed. |

---

## Section E — Free-text explanation (paste into the form / privacy policy)

> Speakr is a client for a user-self-hosted Speakr transcription server. All
> audio recordings and associated metadata are transmitted only to the server
> URL the user configures; the developer operates no backend and never receives
> user data. Recordings can include the microphone and, when the user turns it
> on for a session and accepts Android's consent dialog, audio played by other
> apps (which may include other call participants); only audio is captured,
> never screen content. Auto-upload sends audio files from folders the user
> selected and then deletes the local file after the server confirms the upload,
> and deletes files shorter than a user-set minimum duration without uploading
> them. The server URL and API token are stored locally in the device's
> encrypted OS secure storage and are sent only to the user's own server for
> authentication. The app integrates no analytics, advertising, or third-party
> tracking. Data deletion is performed by the user on their own server or device.

## Items to CONFIRM before submitting (do not guess on the form)

1. ~~**Encryption in transit**~~ — **SETTLED 2026-09-22: answer No.** The app
   allows cleartext HTTP (`usesCleartextTraffic="true"`) for self-hosted LAN
   servers by design, so the all-or-nothing "all data encrypted in transit" box
   cannot be ticked truthfully. Option (b) — enforcing HTTPS in a future build —
   was rejected because it would cut off the LAN users the setting exists for.
   Nothing left to confirm; see Section A.
2. **"Shared" vs. "Collected"** — this draft treats the user's own server as the
   user's designated destination (Collected, not Shared with a third party).
   Re-read Play's current definition of "third party"; if Google considers the
   self-hosted server a third party in your interpretation, you may need to mark
   audio/metadata as **Shared**. When unsure, the more conservative answer
   (declare it) is safer.
3. **Transcripts/summaries** — confirm whether server-generated content fetched
   back to the app needs to be declared as a collected data type, per Play's
   latest definitions.
4. ~~**Privacy policy URL**~~ — **DONE.** The policy text is final in
   `privacy-policy.md` and published as `site/privacy-policy.html` (generated;
   CI checks the two match).
   **https://inrego.github.io/Minutes-for-Speakr/privacy-policy.html is live and returns
   HTTP 200.** The Data Safety answers above were reconciled against the
   2026-09-22 policy text; re-check them if the policy changes again.
